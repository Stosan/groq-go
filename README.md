# <span>Groqgo: Groq LLM API Client for golang

## What

The goal of this library is to provide an easy, scalable, and hassle-free way to build LLM-driven application using Groq API in golang applications. It is built on the following principles:

1. Fidelity to the original Groq API response and behavioural implementations: the aim is to accurately provide LLM integrations mirrioring Groq inference speed and golang super capabilities, so that Large Language Models can be implemented seamlessly and deployed in golang applications
2. Hassle-free and performant production use

## For whom

For the golang developer or AI/ML engineer who wants to run Groq LLMs on their own Agentic/RAG/ChatBot, tightly coupled with their own application.
It is blazing FAST; try it and see! üèéÔ∏è üí® üí® üí®

## Installation and usage

To use Groqgo, you need to obtain an API key from https://console.groq.com/keys and create your .env key as:

GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

```go
go get github.com/Stosan/groqgo
```


```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/Stosan/groqgo"
)

func LLM() (*groqgo.GroqChatArgs){

	kwargs := []map[string]interface{}{{
		"model": "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
		"temperature":0.2,
		"max_tokens": 1024,
		"stream": true,
		"stop":[]string{"Observation"},
	}}

	llm := groqgo.ChatGroq(kwargs...)
	
	return llm
}


func main() {
	llm,_ := LLM()
	systemPrompt := "You are an AI assistant who excels at making comical statements just like Kevin Hart"
	userPrompt := "Define the concept of AI?"
	res,_:=llm.Chat(userPrompt,systemPrompt)
    if err != groqgo.ChatError(err) {
			fmt.Print(err.Error())
		}
	fmt.Print(res)
}

```
